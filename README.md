## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- SCSS with CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow
- Gulp for task automation (build, styles, images)
- [Stylelint](https://stylelint.io/) for CSS linting and code quality
- [gh-pages](https://www.npmjs.com/package/gh-pages) for deployment

### What I learned

- How to implement **hover state** with SCSS and maintain accessibility
- Implement **reduced motion** for users who prefer minimal animation
- How to organize SCSS files conceptually (abstracts, base, components, layout, pages, themes, vendors)

Example SCSS snippet with modern accessibility considerations:

```scss
.card {
  &__title {
    transition: color 0.2s ease-in-out;

    &:hover {
      color: abstracts.$color-yellow;
      cursor: pointer;
    }

    @media (prefers-reduced-motion: reduce) {
      transition: none;
    }
  }
}
```

### Continued development

- Implement a conceptual CSS property ordering system to improve readability and maintainability

- Explore more accessible design patterns for focus and hover states

- Add CSS logical properties for internationalization support

- Refactor Gulp tasks for better error handling and image optimization
